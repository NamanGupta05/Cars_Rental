      " If your car battery is low, it’s crucial to address the situation promptly to avoid being stranded. Start by turning off all unnecessary electronics, such as lights and the radio, to conserve the remaining charge. If the engine still starts, drive for at least 15–30 minutes to allow the alternator to recharge the battery. In cases where the car won’t start, you may need to jump-start it using jumper cables and a functional battery or a portable jump starter. Additionally, inspect the battery terminals for corrosion or loose connections and clean or tighten them as needed. For recurring issues, have the battery professionally tested to check its health and ensure the alternator and electrical system are functioning properly. By maintaining your battery and avoiding frequent short trips that don’t allow for adequate charging, you can prevent future problems and ensure reliable performance.",
